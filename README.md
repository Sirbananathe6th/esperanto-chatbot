# What is this?

Need a friend to speak Esperanto with? Need a friend period? Well this robot can fill that empty void in your heart! It uses GPT-3, the most powerful language processing model in the world, just to sass you in Esperanto.

For people that aren't fluent in Esperanto, dont worry! There is no need to put the bot's responses into a translator! This site uses Google Translate to give you the ability to translate the responses that the robot gives you. If you click or tap on any of the bot's responses, they will be translated into English. For now, we just have English, but I plan to expand the languages to include all the ones availible on google translate.
